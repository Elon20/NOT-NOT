# NOT-NOT
Python version of android popular game NOT NOT

I was playing this android game "NOT NOT" and the logic seemed simple enough. So tried this python version.
You have to press Keyboard arrow keys shown in prompt before timeout (3 seconds)
Main challenge was keeping track of input and timeout in parallel but this solution worked for me - https://stackoverflow.com/a/41812246/13506777
